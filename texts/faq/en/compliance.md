1. Why are reported daily new cases eventually saturating even at 0% compliance?
In contrast to the number of newly infected individuals, the increase of the incidence of reported cases obviously slows down even at 0% compliance – that is, without the intervention showing any effect. The reason is that the number of infectious individuals becomes so large that the testing system will be overwhelmed and the fractions of infections staying undetected increases considerably.


2. Is vaccination considered in this model?
Vaccination is not explicitly considered in the compliance model.


3. Does the model consider multiple virus strains or variants of concern?
The compliance model does not explicitly consider multiple virus strains, nor variants of concern.


4. Can I change data “pre-intervention”?
The pre-intervention period is  fixed for all scenarios that can be selected for simulation with the Webtool. The parametrization of the compliance model is inspired by the COVID-19 situation in Germany during the early fall 2020, when a new lockdown period was introduced to slow down the second COVID-19 wave. This means in particular (i) that the reproduction number in the pre-intervention time is lower than in an uncontrolled situation (here specifically reduced to 1.5 due to mild restrictions such as person-person distance, face masks, prohibition of large events etc., by assumption adhered to by the whole population), and (ii) that a certain fraction of the population has been immunized through natural infection until the beginning of the intervention period.


5. Can I change the population size? 
The population size is fixed to 83 million and at present cannot be changed for simulation with the Webtool.


6. Can I visualize simulations longer than 5 weeks after beginning of interventions?
The simulation time of 5 weeks after introduction of interventions cannot be changed at present. The 5 weeks interval was selected as a reasonable time period to assess the effect of a particular intervention strategy.
