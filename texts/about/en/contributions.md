The CoSiMo (COVID-19 Simulation and Modeling) Project was established in March 2020 from a collaboration between the Frankfurt Institute for Advanced Studies ([Maria Barbarossa’s research group](https://www.fias.science/en/life-sciences/research-groups/maria-barbarossa/)) and the [Jülich Supercomputing Center](https://www.fz-juelich.de/portal/EN/Press/PressReleases/2020/2020-03-23-corona-fzj-en/_node.html). The team developed mathematical models and simulations for the spread and control of COVID-19 in Germany that were used, among others,

* to predict the effect of nonpharmaceutical intervention during the first COVID-19 wave

https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0238559

* to highlight the importance of the assertion ratio (that is, how many cases we detected over the total amount of infected people)

* to explain the effect of panic behavior just before strict measures (lockdown) are implemented

* to predict the outcome of short time lockdowns and to propose possible control strategies on the emerging second wave in the autumn of 2020

* to emphasize the importance of compliance with nonpharmaceutical interventions and how non-compliance can lead to a plateau in case numbers despite strict contact measures

The team contributes also with weekly and regional short-term projections to the [German and Polish Forecast Hub](https://kitmetricslab.github.io/forecasthub/forecast) as well as to the [European COVID-19 Forecast Hub](https://covid19forecasthub.eu/).
