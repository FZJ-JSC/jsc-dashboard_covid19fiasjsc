The tab *Selected output* shows the chosen model output as a line chart with lines of different color corresponding to the selected *Compliance levels*.

These outputs show the state of the epidemic over time; in this example you visualize the *reported active cases*, that is the number of currently infectious individuals that have been confirmed by PCR testing.

Notice that known cases do not include underreporting (infected, but undetected individuals). Due to limited testing capacity, known cases may increase more slowly if many individuals are infected while total cases are still increasing exponentially fast (compare, e.g. *reported active cases* and *total active cases* for 0% compliance). The more individuals are infected, the more pronounced the difference between known and total cases.

The default view shows five weeks after the intervention, you can view the full simulated time including the time before intervention by selecting *From start of simulation*.  
Up to the time of intervention, all scenarios are the same.
